## Titrations

```{r, out.width="800px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path= "images/titration.png")
```

???

- Already included Excel in intro chem, i.e. Titrations

---

## Calorimetry

```{r, out.width="800px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path= "images/CHM135_cal2.png")

???

- And Calorimetry
- Problem is inconsistency implementation and introduction
- No comprehensive lab showcasing excel

- Inspired by the worldload of CHM410 labs

???

- Students pool samples together and get a lot of data
- Numerous call curves leads to rote excel work
- Excel workflow doesn't scale as pool of analytes increases
- Excel hides errors (see numbers not operations...)
- Limited statistical test and visualizations

## In response to demands from students and needs from courses we wrote *R4EnvChem*, a course agnotics data analysis textbook

```{r, out.width="1000px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path= "images/r4envchem_splash.png")
```

???

- Central, course-agnostic textbook 
- Information can be used by any prof/TA/student
- Common workflows and functions means transferability between courses
- Scores of options at fingertips once established in R
- This presentation made with R...

## Accesible interactive widgets greatly expand student independance in data analysis 

.pull-left[

```{r plot-last, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# Import & Tidy data

atr <- read_csv("data/atr.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, 
               names_to = "plastic",
               values_to = "intensity")

# Create plot

p <- ggplot(data = atr,
            aes(x = wavenumber, 
                y = intensity, 
                colour = plastic)) +
  geom_point()


# interactive plot

ggplotly(p)

  geom_point(size = 1)


# interactive plot

ggplotly(p)

- This snippet replaces a lot of commercial software...
- Students can spend more time thinking about their data then handling it...
