## Undergraduate laboratories  are supposed to give students a deeper understanding of the scientific process

## To provide this understanding, labs must reflect </br> the reality of scientific research

## Whether we like it or not, we are living in the age of data;</br> chemistry is no exception.

##  Yet undergraduate labs often fail to reflect present and *future* reality

## The fundamentals are as important as ever...

- going to remake this  figure for undergrad labs: pre-lab -> prep -> (experimment <-> observe <-> document <->) -> Communicate 

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='900px'}

## ... we just need to introduce similar fundamentals for data science

## We decided to explicitly introduce data-science into undergraduate laboraties both with *Excel* and programming (*R*)

## Easy interactive widgets greatly expand student independance in data analysis
