I think a good thing to include would be a file directory on Quercus where all the files could be found in addition to having them hyperlinked in the modules. It is easy to miss one when going back to work on the assignment for a second time and often results in many windows open. I think having all those files in one place would be helpful"

Not even on a different matrix or using different techniques (although there's room for that), but looking at things like partitioning or reactivity would be valuable.

The air lab was interesting, but it just didn't match the rigor or intellectual level of the remaining labs or the rest of the content.  I feel like it could be altered to make it more complex and interesting, but as it is I don't feel like I learned that much from it. "

Course was absolutely fantastic in its material and the way it was taught. Really appreciated the extensions - showed that the professor cared more about students learning than strict logistics. The in-person labs were also really enjoyable! The suggestions I have for this course are:

1. Spend the first couple of weeks doing overview on organic chemistry as well as what this course is about. Perhaps just describing the whole process from extraction -> LC/GC -> MS without going into too much detail. I was only able to see the big picture maybe 2/3s into the semester. I think I would have understood much more if I had the larger framework in mind from the beginning.
2. The timing of the labs was not always the most efficient. For example, we would be focusing on Lab 4 things when Lab 3 report was due in that week. For me, with my mind all wrapped up in Lab 3, I didn't have the time to even look over Lab 4 so I came very unprepared to that lab and wasn't able to take as much advantage of that time. I would recommend having less overlap between the different labs (i do realize that it is difficult since these labs take a long stretch of time).
3. As mentioned above, perhaps downgrade the Lab 5 deliverable from a full-out paper to a less-demanding mini report similar to Lab 2, where we can focus more on the content instead of worrying about formatting, little details, etc. I really did like how the course made you write actual research papers because I think it was a great skill to learn. But doing it twice was difficult with everything else that was due.

But none of the above are complaints! Just my personal feedback on helping the course be better. Thank you again Professor for all your help! And for being so available with office hours and everything. All the best!"
